  # How to Open/Load Pickle File 

```python
import pickle

# Load Pickle file
with open("model.pkl", "rb") as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)
    
# Example Data (Number of Features will be according to your trained model)
features = [[8, 512, 2.4]]   # such as [RAM(GB), Storage(GB), Processor Speed(GHz)]

# Take Prediction
prediction = model.predict(features)
print("Predicted Laptop Price:", prediction[0])
